# Token Standards Working Group

## Mission Statement

This working group is concerned with all aspects related to token and ledger standards. The group is the merger of the former "Ledger and Token" and "NFT" Working Groups. This repository is used to collaborate, document decisions, discuss changes, raise issues, and provide feedback.

## Process

The following process is followed for standards within this working group.

If you have a good idea or a need for a standard, feel free to join a meeting or bring it up on the [forum][FORUM]
or [Discord][DISCORD].

Keep in mind it should be related to token standards on the IC to be picked up. If you have other
ideas, still feel free to reach out, and we'll try to help you find the right working group.

These ideas are then translated into the draft standards by their original contributor and/or with help of members
within this working group. Draft standards enable developers to create early reference implementations.

Approved standards are actively being implemented by developers and are candidates for an official ICRC standard once
adoption has reached an adequate level.
